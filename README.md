# chapatt-webtk
A simple HTML- and JavaScript-based UI widget toolkit intended to supplant the HTML form elements, allowing styling beyond that afforded by the pseudo-element selector mechanism. A specific goal is a slider in the style of [Blender](https://blender.org) or [GIMP](https://gimp.org).

Widgets can be bound to HTML elements manually via JavaScript, or by applying certain classes and data attributes by which the JavaScript application respectively registers and configures the widgets (similar to AngularJS Directives).
